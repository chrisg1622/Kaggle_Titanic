I wrote this script to showcase a basic solution to the famous Titanic Kaggle Competition.

The aim of the competition is to predict whether a passenger would survive (yes/no), given certain relevant attributes (e.g. Age, Gender)

I pre-processed the data and trained a simple random forest model which achieves 78% accuracy on the test data.
